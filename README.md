The Grievance System is an online platform designed to provide individuals with
a seamless way to report and resolve grievances or complaints within an organization or
community. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to submit their complaints, track
their progress, and receive real-time updates on any actions taken by the administration to
address their concerns. The site features an administrative dashboard that allows the
administration to view all complaints and take prompt action to resolve them. The site also
allows for anonymous reporting to ensure users feel comfortable reporting their grievances.
The Grievance Site aims to create a safe and secure environment for all users and promote open
communication and transparency between the administration and individuals.

           The proposed project, "Grievance Site," is designed to maintain the details of students
through an website controlled by the admin. Students can register and log in to the site, post
their grievances, and receive prompt resolution of their concerns. This project aims to simplify
the process of reporting grievances for students, eliminating the need to meet with their dean
in person. The site allows students to report their grievances at any time, providing a convenient
and efficient way to address their concerns. The admin can view all grievances in the admin
module and take necessary actions to rectify them. Overall, this project streamlines the
management of student grievances and ensures that students' concerns are addressed
promptly and effectively.
